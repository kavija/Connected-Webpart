# Connected-Webpart

Recently I have come across a situation where we need a page which should be divided into 2 parts where one half should have items and based on the item selection, you should get the details (Just like a HTML frame).

What we have is two webparts and an interface

Interface enable us to share the data between the webparts.

Provider webpart exposes the interface whereas the consumer webpart accepts the interface.
